# Consul and Vault AMI

AMI with Vault and Consul binaries installed. DNSmasq is also configured to use the local
Consul agent as its DNS server.

This is based on this [example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-vault/tree/master/examples/vault-consul-ami).

## Pre-requisites

### Generate a CA and intermediate CA

1. Refer to the [`ca`](ca/README.md) for instructions on how to setup a CA with the associated keys.

## Configuration Options

See [this page](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/user-variables.html) for more information.

- `aws_region`: AWS Region
- `subnet_id`: ID of subnet to run the builder instance in
- `temporary_security_group_source_cidr`: Temporary CIDR to allow SSH access from
- `associate_public_ip_address`: Associate to `true` if the machine provisioned is to be connected via the internet
- `ssh_interface`: One of `public_ip`, `private_ip`, `public_dns` or `private_dns`. If set, either the public IP address, private IP address, public DNS name or private DNS name will used as the host for SSH.
