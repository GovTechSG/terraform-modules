# Nomad Vault Integration

This module is an example on how you can setup integration between Vault and Nomad. Refer to
[this page](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/vault-integration/index.html) for more information.

This is intended to be used alongside the [core](../core) module.

## Pre-requisites

You must have Terraformed the [core](../core) module first. In addition, you must have at least
initialised and unsealed the Vault servers.

Your Vault instances must also have the appropriate
[IAM policy](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html#recommended-vault-iam-policy) applied
to them. Otherwise, the instances cannot perform verification with the AWS API.

This module includes Terraforming the IAM policy, if you choose to enable it via the
`create_iam_policy` variable. The policy created by this module does not include the
`sts:AssumeRole` action, which is only needed if you want to use cross account access.

## Vault Provider

Refer to the [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vault/index.html) on the
Terraform Vault provider for details on how you can provide a Vault token for this Terraform
operation. In general, you might want to do this with a Root token.

## Vault Token

Instead of generating a Vault Token by hand while configuring Nomad, we instead choose to configure
Vault to enable the [AWS authentication method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html) so
that Nomad servers instance will be able to retrieve a token on first boot purely by authenticating
with Vault via their Instance Profile.

## Integration with `Core` module

After you have applied this module, a key will be set in Consul's KV store. The default
`user_data` scripts of the Core's Nomad servers and clients will check for the presence of this
key in Consul to configure themselves accordingly. Refer to the Core module's documentation on how
to update your Nomad cluster.
